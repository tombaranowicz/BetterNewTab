# Better New Tab
Better New Tab is Chrome Extension which overrides your 'New Tab' page to suggest pages that you are usually visiting at this time (e.g. it's Monday, 9:00AM -> it shows websites that are most visited on Mondays between 8:30 and 9:30 AM).

## Idea
To be honest i am still surprised that Google cannot find out that depending on time i usually visit different websites. 
My chrome browser life looks probably like for a lot of other developers: 
- at work (Mon-Fri 9am - 5pm) i usually visit websites related to my projects, github, stackoverflow etc.
- at home (Mon-Fri 6pm - 10pm) i usually read news, check social media, watch yt

It's really easy to notice a pattern here, but still, my new tab in chrome looks the same all the time. 
It doesn't matter if it's Monday morning or Saturday evening, it constantly looks like this:

I thought that it cannot be so hard to quickly write something better, so i started with a logic diagram and you can see final effect below:

After spending a pretty long evening coding this i developed Better New Tab and you can see effects below (i'm really bad at design, i know):

It doesn't look fancy, but at least works more efficient than standard new tab from Google. I hope you will also find it useful.
